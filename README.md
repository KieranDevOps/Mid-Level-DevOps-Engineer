# Mid-Level DevOps Engineer – Media - London – up to £60,000 - POSITION FILLED

# Stack: 
AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, ansible, Jenkins, Jira etc on the toolchain side.
Node.js, Ruby, *.Net* from a codebase perspective.

# The company: 
A multi award winning Media organisation that manages 1000’s of brands in publishing, Radio, Digital and Television, reaching 20+ million customers.

# The culture: 
They have a very flat structure with the CTO regularly rolling up his sleeves and bashing out some code when needed. They actively promote a relaxed working environment with flexible working hours and options to work remotely. The engineers are given plenty of time to innovate and put together POC’s… many of which end up in production. The introduction of Terraform for example came from a POC.

# The role: 
This role will be working in a team of 3, one being another DevOps Engineer that comes from a Ops background. You will be bringing the developer insight to the table, helping design, implement and manage solutions relating the CMS transformation and platforming initiative. You will also be responsible for maintaining and maturing the new platform (AWS).

# Project examples: 
The company is currently 6 months into a major transformation to consolidate a varied legacy technology estate, including 120+ Content management systems, to a single publicly hosted cloud platform, running microservices and a single CMS (Node.js based).
There is also a POC in flight exploring the benefits of Kubernetes for orchestration. Not yet production ready but it’s only a matter of time!

# What experience is required?
- Above all else, a passion for technology and positive attitude towards self-learning and development is key. This is a very complex architecture and require an inquisitive mind to both understand it and to unearth opportunities to improve it.
- You will come from a development background, ideally comfortable with node.js.
- You will be strong with AWS. They are running a huge amount of services including Lambda in production.
- Exposure to Docker and Kubernetes beneficial.
- A solid understanding of Linux systems. 
- Experience with Ansible/Puppet useful.
